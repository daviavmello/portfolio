<p>Davi Mello is a student of graphic design, illustrator, and typography born in Brazil. With productions ranging from music album covers to company branding, he is willing to experiment outside the ordinary. Minimalism and collaboration inspire his works.</p>
<p>His interest in design began in 2015 when his music project was currently releasing his first EP and needed an album cover. Even without experience, the challenge was accepted. The end result was well accepted and what at first was only an interest, began to become a great passion for design. After that, other opportunities emerged to integrate his church's creative team and administer social networks.</p></div><!-- closes .column1 div-->
<div class="column2">
<p> His interest in graphic design made Davi seek to meet other people in the area to be trained and, to a certain extent, mentored by professionals in his area. Things began to change course when, at the end of 2016, Davi decided to drop out of his Accounting Sciences college, move to the United States, and pursue graphic design. At the moment, opting for design meant choosing it not only as a hobby, but also as a career. Although somewhat uncertain of what was expected at first, the panaroma shifted after the first few months of adaptation. Currently, after finishing the second semester in college, Davi is heading toward the third semester of the program. Since then, Davi Mello has sought to improve and connect with people to learn and collaborate.</p></div><!-- closes .column2 div-->
