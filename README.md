## Features

### 1. Angular Standalone Components

The backbone of this portfolio website is the use of Angular Standalone components. Each section of the website, such as the hero section, about me, projects & skills, and contact, is implemented as a separate Angular component. This modular approach makes it easy to manage and update different sections of the website independently. It also promotes code reusability, making it a breeze to add new sections or make changes in the future.

### 2. Tailwind CSS for Styling

The website's sleek and responsive design is powered by Tailwind CSS. Tailwind CSS's utility-first approach allowed me to create a consistent and visually appealing layout without the need for custom CSS. It also makes it effortless to maintain responsive design across various screen sizes, ensuring that the portfolio looks great on both desktop and mobile devices.

### 3. Project Showcase

One of the core features of my portfolio is the project showcase section. It provides detailed information about the projects I've worked on, including project descriptions, technologies used, and links to GitHub repositories or live demos. Each project is displayed as a card, making it easy for visitors to explore my work.

### 4. Skills and Expertise

In the skills section, I've listed my technical skills and areas of expertise. The use of Angular Standalone components allows me to easily update this section to reflect any changes in my skill set as I continue to grow in my career.

### 5. Contact Information

To encourage interaction and networking, my portfolio includes a contact section where visitors can get in touch with me. Whether it's for collaboration, inquiries, or just saying hello, I've made it convenient for visitors to reach out.
