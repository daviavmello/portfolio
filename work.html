<p>Less is more. But what makes this sentence so simple something so emblematic and that draws so much attention? What fascinates us in creation is the power to express everything we feel, know, and our burden of experience on a given job. This, of course, without leaving aside the main focus of the work: to convey what the customer wants to sell. Whether this is a concept, a product or a service. Although we know what to do, the excitement of the creative in that work can use several elements. Or just follow a market trend. Without being aware of it ourselves, we are subject to create polluted jobs and this visual pollution in an amount brings fatigue to the eyes and the brain that absorbs daily an excessive dose of information. And it is in the midst of this visual chaos that the clean stands out. Minimalism is not just what to wear or drink coffee with or without sugar. This is also part of it, but it may not be the greatest benefit of this type of approach. message.</p></div><!-- closes .column1 div-->

<p>When we take a position to focus our minds on the big choices and goals, we naturally give less importance to small things. From architecture to music and logos, the elements are reduced to their most elementary form. Nowadays, the concept can be perceived as the most striking design trend all around us. Sites, buildings, packaging, smartphones, all of them minimalist. No wonder big companies are sticking to motion, using simplicity to maximize the effect. A great example is Google, which applied the concept of "Material Design" in all its products. To use this style of design, the professional tends to use more white space, a simpler and less fancy typography, grid layout with less color. However, that does not mean you have to take it all off and leave only black text on a white background. That's where the balcony is: to get one creation to differ substantially from the other by passing on the intended.</p></div><!-- closes .column2 div-->
