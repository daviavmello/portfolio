* **Reset the headings** and set a default font style on body;
* **Remove unncessary styles:** such as: background repeat, list styles, etc;
* **Reset form fields:** buttons and inputs looks the same now, in so any styles;
* **Prevent chrome autofill style:** remove that yellow box on fields;
* **Border-box box sizing:** so that borders and paddings don't affect the set dimensions;
